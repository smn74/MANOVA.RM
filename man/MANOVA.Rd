\usage{
MANOVA(
  formula,
  data,
  subject,
  iter = 10000,
  alpha = 0.05,
  resampling = "paramBS",
  para = FALSE,
  CPU,
  seed,
  nested.levels.unique = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A model \code{\link{formula}} object. The left hand side 
contains the response variable and the right hand side contains the factor 
variables of interest.}

\item{data}{A data.frame, list or environment containing the variables in 
\code{formula}. Data must be in long format and must not contain missing values.}

\item{subject}{The column name of the subjects in the data.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations used for calculating the resampled 
statistic. The default option is 10,000.}

\item{alpha}{A number specifying the significance level; the default is 0.05.}

\item{resampling}{The resampling method to be used, one of "paramBS"
(parametric bootstrap approach) and "WildBS" (wild bootstrap approach with
Rademacher weights).}

\item{para}{If parallel computing should be used. Default is FALSE.}

\item{CPU}{The number of cores used for parallel computing. If not specified, cores
are detected via \code{\link[parallel]{detectCores}}.}

\item{seed}{A random seed for the resampling procedure. If omitted, no 
reproducible seed is set.}

\item{nested.levels.unique}{A logical specifying whether the levels of the nested factor(s)
are labeled uniquely or not. Default is FALSE, i.e., the levels of the nested 
factor are the same for each level of the main factor. For an example and more explanations
see the GFD package and the corresponding vignette.}

\item{dec}{Number of decimals the results should be rounded to. Default is 3.}
}
\value{
A \code{MANOVA} object containing the following components: 
  \item{Descriptive}{Some descriptive statistics of the data for all factor 
  level combinations. Displayed are the number of individuals per factor 
  level combination and the vector of means (one column per dimension).}
  \item{Covariance}{The estimated covariance matrix.} 
  \item{WTS}{The value of the WTS along with degrees of freedom of the
  central chi-square distribution and p-value.} 
  \item{MATS}{The value of the MATS.} 
  \item{resampling}{p-values for the test statistic based on the
  chosen resampling approach.}
}
\description{
The MANOVA function calculates the Wald-type statistic (WTS) and a modified ANOVA-type 
statistic (MATS) as well as resampling versions of 
these test statistics for 
semi-parametric multivariate data.
}
\details{
The MANOVA() function provides the Wald-type statistic (WTS) as well as
  the modified ANOVA-type statistic (MATS) for multivariate designs with metric data as described in 
  Konietschke et al. (2015) and Friedrich and Pauly (2018), respectively. The MATS is invariant
  under scale transformations of the components and applicable to designs with singular covariance
  matrices.
  Both tests are applicable for non-normal error terms, 
  different sample sizes and/or heteroscedastic variances.
  They are implemented for designs with an arbitrary number of
  crossed factors or for nested designs. In addition to the asymptotic
  p-values, the function also provides p-values based on resampling approaches.
}
\section{NOTE}{
 The number of resampling iterations has been set to 10 in the examples due to run time 
restrictions on CRAN. Usually it is recommended to use at least 1000 iterations. 
For more information and detailed examples also refer to the package vignette.
