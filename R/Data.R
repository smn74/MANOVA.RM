#' EEG Measurements in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease (long format)
#'
#' At the Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Salzburg, 160 patients were diagnosed
#' with either AD, MCI, or SCC, based on neuropsychological diagnostics. This data set contains z-scores for brain rate and Hjorth complexity,
#' each measured at frontal, temporal and central electrode positions and averaged across hemispheres. In addition to standardization, complexity
#' values were multiplied by -1 in order to make them more easily comparable to brain rate
#' values: For brain rate we know that the values decrease with age and pathology, while
#' Hjorth complexity values are known to increase with age and pathology.
#' The three between-subjects factors considered were sex (men vs. women), diagnosis (AD
#' vs. MCI vs. SCC), and age (\eqn{< 70} vs. \eqn{>= 70} years). Additionally, the within-subjects factors region (frontal, temporal, central) and 
#' feature (brain rate, complexity) structure the response vector.

#'   \item{diagnosis}{neuropsychological diagnosis, AD for Alzheimer's Disease, MCI for mild cognitive impairment or SCC for subjective cognitive complaints without clinically significant deficits}
